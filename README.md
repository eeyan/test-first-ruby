# Test-First-Ruby

These are my own solutions to the Test First Ruby problems. The solutions can be found in lib, and the tests are all  in spec. Feel free to check out my solutions if you are working on these probelms or something similar, but, as always, please try it on your own first!

I make no guarantees that these are the best / fastest / most ruby-like solutions, but these are the solutions that made the most sense to me. I came up with them while teaching myself ruby, so hopefully they may be of some use to anyone else starting off with ruby.
